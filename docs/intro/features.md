# Features
Out of the box, we wanted to create a low level robust framework on which
to build charts. Outside of the following chart types:

### Chart Types
- Horizontal & Vertical Bar Charts (Standard, Grouped, Stacked, Normalized)
- Line 
- Area (Standard, Stacked, Normalized)
- Pie (Explodable, Grid, Custom legends)
- Donut
- Gauge
- Force Directed Graph
- Heatmap
- Treemap
- Number Cards
- Bubble/Scatter

### Customization
- Autoscaling
- Timeline Filtering
- Line Interpolation
- Configurable Axis Labels
- Legends (Labels & Gradient)
- Advanced Label Positioning
- Real-time data support
- Advanced Tooltips
- Responsive Layout
- Data point Event Handlers
- Works with ngUpgrade

If you have an idea for a new feature, create a Github issue or even better a PR ;).
Make sure to include the use case, an example image of the chart (if applicable) and
data formats.

## Alternatives
Chart frameworks are a dime a dozen nowadays. Not many of them existed 2+
years ago when we started this project internally and many of them still don't really work well with Angular. Here's a recent list
