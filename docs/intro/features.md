# Features
Out of the box, we wanted to create a low level robust framework on which
to build charts. Outside of the following chart types:

### Chart Types
- Horizontal & Vertical Bar Charts (Standard, Grouped, Stacked, Normalized)
- Line 
- Area (Standard, Stacked, Normalized)
- Pie (Explodable, Grid, Custom legends)
- Donut
- Gauge
- Force Directed Graph
- Heatmap
- Treemap
- Number Cards

### Customization
- Autoscaling
- Timeline Filtering
- Line Interpolation
- Configurable Axis Labels
- Legends (Labels & Gradient)
- Advanced Label Positioning
- Real-time data support
- Advanced Tooltips
- Data point Event Handlers
- Works with ngUpgrade

## Coming Soon
- Responsive Layout
- Transitions / Animations
- Better RX Support
- More Chart Types such as Bubble, Radar, Scatter

If you have an idea for a new feature, create a Github issue or even better a PR ;).
Make sure to include the use case, an example image of the chart (if applicable) and
data formats.

## Alternatives
Chart frameworks are a dime a dozen nowadays. Not many of them existed 2+
years ago when we started this project internally and many of them still don't really work well with Angular. Here's a recent list
we compiled during our effort to open-source this:

- [recharts](http://recharts.org/)
- [Vega](http://vega.github.io/)
- [C3](http://c3js.org/)
- [Plotly](https://plot.ly/)
- [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/)
- [eCharts](http://echarts.baidu.com/demo.htm)
- [dc.js](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js)
