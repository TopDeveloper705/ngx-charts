D3 + Angular2 Composable Re-usable Charting Framework. 

ng2d3 is unique because we don't merely wrap d3, nor any other chart engine for that matter, its truley Angular rendering the SVGs with all its binding and speed goodness and d3 for its excellent internals such as: math algorithms, scales, etc. By having Angular do all the rendering it opens us up to endless possibilities the Angular platform provides such as AoT, Universal, etc. 

Data visualization is a science but that doesn't mean it has to be ugly. One of the big efforts we've made while creating this project is to make beautiful data visualizations, out of the box we provide a variety of color schemes that are both beautiful and meaningful when applied correctly.
